### Directions on Using Webstorm
Install webstorm by registering your education email and downloading the latest version from their website. You also want to install the latest version of Git as a local program that is appropriate to your system OS and create a Github account with a unique username and email address. To connect Github with Webstorm, you want to open Webstorm and press Ctrl + Alt + S to show the settings. On the left side of the bar, you want to click Version control and then Git. This will allow you to choose the path to the git.exe and then be able to test it to see if it is in the correct place.
